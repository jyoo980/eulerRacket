## eulerRacket: beautiful functional programming ##

I have solved a variety of common problems which manipulate data structures or leverage algorithms in Racket, a dialect of Scheme. The reason for using Racket is due to its simple syntax, relatively compact IDE, and its similarity to Common Lisp. Below are some of the functions I have implemented:

* Prime number generation up to a given integer n
* Tail-recursive fibonacci sequence generation
* List operations
    * skipping elements
    * interleave
    * implementations of map, fold, filter, and other first-order functions
    * removal of duplicate elements
    * retrieval of the kth element of a list 
* Naive primality algorithms
* Anagram checks for strings
* Palindrome checks for strings and lists

Below, you can see an example of the syntax of Racket, and a problem I have solved using it. Take a look!
